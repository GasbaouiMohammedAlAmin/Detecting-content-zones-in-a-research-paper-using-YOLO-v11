# Detecting content zones in a research paper using YOLO v11
fine-tuning YOLO v11 using the Roboflow dataset for content zone detection in a research paper.

The aim of detecting whether content is a text, figure, or table in an image or document using YOLO could be driven by several objectives, such as:
- Document Layout Analysis: Understanding the structure of documents to organize or categorize content, this is helpful for automated systems like PDF-to-text converters or data extraction systems that need to differentiate between explanatory text, visual figures, and tabular data.
- Enhanced Information Retrieval: Automatically classify and extract specific information based on its type.
- Simplifying Research Workflows: Segmenting papers to navigate figures, tables, or specific sections quickly.

Detecting content zones helps automate and improve document understanding, significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing the accuracy and usability of document processing systems.

# What are we going to do?

We aim to fine-tune YOLO v11 using a specific dataset obtained from the Roboflow Universe website. The dataset comprises approximately 8.6K images of research papers, annotated with three classes: text, figure, and table. A pre-configured Google Colab project is available in this repository to guide you through each step of the process.

The workflow includes the following steps:

- Set up your API key in Google Colab after creating a Roboflow account.
- Utilize a free T4 GPU in Colab to accelerate the training process.
- Analyze the dataset, including counting the number of instances for each class.
- Fine-tune a pre-trained YOLO v11 nano model for optimal performance.
- Evaluate the results using metrics such as the confusion matrix, F1 score, and precision.
- Test the model using your own images to assess its real-world performance.

After approximately one hour of training, the results of the model are summarized in the following table:
